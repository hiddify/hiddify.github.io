[bootstrap5-template](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template) is a basic template repository to create a [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) site using Jekyll on GitHub Pages (or where every you want to host it). 
The layout is based on the [Bootstrap starter template example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/) with a navbar, search box (using lunr.js), and sticky footer.
It is intended as a quick starting point for creating new web projects.

The basic steps for using bootstrap-template are: 

1. create repository from the template
2. edit _config.yml
3. edit content pages
4. use customization options

See [docs/create-website.md](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template/blob/main/docs/create-website.md) for details!
